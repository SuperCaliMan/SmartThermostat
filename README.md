Thermostat funtions:
* Switch to manual mode for power on/off the boiler
* Switch to automatic mode for setting the temperature that you want
* Show humidity inside your house
* Show outside temperature and humidity
* Automatic reconnection if WiFi disconnect
* Set operating time
* Send email in case of error
* If inside temperature is less than zero switch on boiler to prevent freezing
* OTA Update


## Getting Started

Clone the repository, create firebase account and create a database with this parameters. You can also check out my example server [example server.](https://gitlab.com/SuperCaliMan/SmartThermostat/blob/master/Firebase.json)<br>
<img src="images/database.png" width=30% height=30%>
<br>Now you can set FIREBASE_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH. You can find your database secret key in firebase, in this project i used this key to connect my board with firebase, for more details look [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37418372/firebase-where-is-my-account-secret-in-the-new-console)
Now register in [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) to get weather data and set your key on Weather setup and set Weather Setup parameters. I use [Firebase-Arduino](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-arduino) API to dialog with nodemcu and firebase. I used this library to send email

Now you are ready to control temperature and humidity in your house.
